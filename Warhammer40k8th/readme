A set of functions written in python to help players of Warhammer 40k
These functions help the players resolve parts of the game quickly that require them to roll a large amount of dice (50+ dice)
I plan on creating three different small applications and then bring them all together with a GUI to allow the use of them.

The three main parts of the application are:

1. Rolling for hits - The user will input the number of attack they are making against a target and the firing units Balistic skill, it will then roll that many dice and any dice that meet the units Balistics skill will be successful

2. Rolling for Wounds

3. Rolling for Saves.
